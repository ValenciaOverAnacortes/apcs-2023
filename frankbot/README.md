What did you build?
I built a discord bot that you can add to a server and it will reply to simple commands. Additionally, I made a counter that updates every time you include rizz in a sentence and a !lyrics command that connects with Musicxmatch API to reply to you with the lyrics of the song you ask to.

What did you learn?
I learnt many things. First of all are the basic commands on JavaScript (which is the language most discord bots are coded on), then I had to learn how to use discord.js, node.js, connect to discord API, connect to Musicxmatch API... I also learned how to save your data on different files and how to access it so the values don't reset every time you restart.
I also learned (by force) that I have to be more careful with the token for security, because it's got posted twice and Discord's "Safety Jim" gets mad at me :(  
    
How can we try it?
Unfortunately, the bot is not public and I would need to buy a hosting server so you guys could invite it to your own servers and try it, so you can't try it :(
